## Assignment report

_In the assignment report, you reflect on your assignment. You can write in English or Swedish._

### Reflection

The hardest part of this assignment was to figure out what parts of the program that could go wrong. Thinking about validation on the server-side and that user can do post requests without going through the form on the client. 

### Further improvments

I would have liked to add more features to the user site. Right now it only shows the snippets that the user has created. Maybe the possibility to favorite other users snippets and save them in a "favorites" section. Also, add an "admin user" with the possibility to remove user snippets and users. If I had more time I would change the css for the "Create Snippet" form.

### Extras

I've added the possibility to see snippets that belong to a specific user.

### Feedback

Really fun assignment. It was tough in the beginning to understand how to log in and how the page should change when a user was logged in.
